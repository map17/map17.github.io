    <div>
     
      <p>LCC's MA Photography programme embraces the diversity of
	visual expression, across media and genres, that is
	contemporary photographic practice. As the class of 2017, we
	come from an international range of cultural and experiential
	backgrounds, and over the past year we have been inspiring
	each other to push the boundaries of modern photography
	through experimental practice, theoretical contextualisation
	and active research. An open-minded, progressive and
	multimedia approach has given us the freedom and autonomy to
	make thoughtful, bold, provocative and conceptually absorbing
	works that engage with our current challenging times.</p>
