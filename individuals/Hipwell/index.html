      <p>I am interested in the relationship between art and science/technology, and how the latter can be used in the service of art for its own sake.

      <p>One way of expressing this dichotomy is in terms of objectivity vs subjectivity. From Louis Daguerre's announcement of "a chemical and physical process which gives [nature] the ability to reproduce herself" [Newhall, 1959] and William Fox Talbot's "Pencil of Nature" [Talbot, 2010], via Karl Blossfeldt's "Urformen der Kunst (Art Forms in Nature)" [Blossfeldt, 1928], to the New Objectivity of The Dusseldorf School and beyond; the topic of objectivity in photography has a long history, as old as the medium itself. This "cold", dead-pan approach contrasts with the more personal practice of artists such as Goldin [2012] or Billingham [2000], illustrating photography's unique, chameleonic ability to traverse a continuum of "jectivity" extremes.

      <p>This work is partly inspired by a description of Chuck Close's photorealist practice by David Campany:

      <p><p style="margin-left: 40px">"The artist's hand is subordinated to a labourious system for translating visual data, which echoes the mechanisms of the photographic source. Close initially grids his canvas and works from an inverted image. He can then relate to it with indifference. In some respects this corresponds to the mechanical indifference of the optical camera lens which inverts the image it casts." [Campany, 2014, page 150]</p>

      <p>Close developed an objective process to introduce the "artificiality of the photograph" into his painted self-portrait, "to flatten it out and make it just information instead of really being me" [Cajori, 2010, 4:29 to 5:11].

      <p>As Bruno Latour puts it in "On the Modern Cult of the Factish Gods",  "The subject learns from mediation. It comes from factishes. It would die without them" [Latour et al., 2010, page 62]. "It is because of so many mediations that [scientific images] are able to be so objectively true . . . the more mediation, the better the grasp of reality" [Latour et al., 2010, page 74-5].
