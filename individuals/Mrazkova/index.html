      <p><i>The underlying issue of intimacy is that it is ultimately based on perspective. Portraiture can be distant and objective just as readily as it can be intimate and subjective. As soon as an artist chooses to interact with the subject - and subject with artist - an agreed communication has occurred and a form of intimacy has been created - whether the interaction is genuine or artificial is entirely at the discretion of the viewer.</i>

      <p>"At arm's length" is a highly personal visual story where Barbora Mrazkova explores themes of intimacy and connection as well as collaboration and confrontation in front of and behind the camera.

      <p>By taking pictures of both strangers and friends Barbora aims to depict different forms of intimacy based on different levels of intensity shared with her subjects. Still-life and portraiture are combined with a documentarian approach in order to question the authenticity of intimacy.

      <p>At heart, this body of work is an attempt by a photographer to get closer to her subjects yet remain at an objective distance; to analyse the nature of her subjects and how connections may be drawn between them, both visually and emotionally.
